# SwiftRockets

Swift Rockets is a Swift Playgrounds book crafted for National Science Week 2020, in which a set of small visual activities teach beginner-intermediate concepts of Swift and the space debris crisis side-by-side.

The book features 6 Playgrounds pages that each have a functionally standalone activity but that builds upon the lessons of those that came before, with unique hand-drawn art and simple code activities to incrementally teach Swift concepts of increasing difficulty. This begins with a print("Hello World"), goes through variables and types and control logic, gently touches on more intermediate issues such as inheritance and memory management, and ends with an introduction to closures through higher-order functions.

Alongside these concepts, a story is also told that goes from posing the challenge of "launching a rocket" to quickly demonstrating that the launching isn't the whole problem.

Swift and Space Junk might seem a weird combination to pick for a Science Week activity, but it's not as unusual as you may think. In fact, it's what I do.

I'm Mars (yes, really) and I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Tasmania, studying how we can use technologies like we use in self-driving cars to detect and manoeuvre around pedestrians to better detect and track junk in space. My primary tool is Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence technologies and one of the few ways we can make such things is with... (you guessed it) Swift! I use Swift all the time for everything from prototyping to making apps, and I love it so much I wrote a book about it (and am now writing a second one) üìöüëç

So if you have any more questions to ask, want more ideas for things to do with Swift, or just want to chat about junk in space, then get in touch!
